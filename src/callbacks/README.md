<h2>About This Directory</h2>

This directory contains all of the app's interactive functionality. The dash callbacks utilize JavaScript to take in user inputs involving the dash components, call a function, and update the attributes of existing components within the app layout. New components are created from a callback by updating the children attribute of an existing component.

In most of the modules, you will find normal Dash callbacks which call a Python function decorated with `@app.callback()` specifying all the input and output components and runs server-side. For cases where minimizing latency is important and Python-specific functionality is not needed, clientside callbacks are used. The `clientside_callback()` is a Dash function that wraps a JavaScript function and a list of inputs and outputs and is executed in the browser.
